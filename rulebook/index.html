At the highest level, there are alternating six-month seasons of military campaigning.</p> <p>The basic sequence of play For Opération Manta can be visualized with the following hierarchy:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>     TACTICAL PHASE 1

     TACTICAL PHASE 2
</code></pre></div><p>In reality, the sequence of the game is a bit more complicated than this (see <a href="/rulebook/play.html#sequence-of-play">Gameplay: Sequence of Play</a>), however, these are the main phases. Let's break down each one.</p> <h3 id="tactical-phases"><a href="#tactical-phases" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tactical Phases</h3> <p>At the broadest level, <code>The Toyota Wars</code> plays out as a sequence of <a href="/rulebook/play.html#tactical-phase-prep">Tactical Phases</a>. Each Tactical Phase is characterized by different fundamental rules and conditions for Movement and Battle. For example, the first Tactical Phase of Opération Manta happens during Rainy Season. During this time, wells are more available to units in the desert (see <a href="">chart</a>), but marshes are more troublesome to navigate in the savanna (see <a href="">chart</a>). The second Tactical Phase, on the other hand, happens during Dry Season. For this reason alone it can be useful to think of Tactical Phases as six-month tropical seasons.</p> <h3 id="impulses"><a href="#impulses" class="header-anchor">#</a> Impulses</h3> <p>Each Tactical Phase is split up into three <a href="/rulebook/play.html#impulses">Impulses</a>. An Impulse is the basic &quot;round&quot; for Toyota Wars, during which each player plays one turn. We might say, then, that each Tactical Phase lasts three rounds, that is, three Impulses.</p> <h3 id="segments"><a href="#segments" class="header-anchor">#</a> Segments</h3> <p>During each Impulse, the Government Player plays first and the Rebel Player plays second. Each player's turn is called a <a href="/rulebook/play.html#segment-receive-reinforcements">Segment</a>. For the government, a Friendly Segment is a Segment during which the government plays; for the Rebel Player, it is the Segment during which the Rebel Player plays. Since <code>The Toyota Wars</code> is a two-person game, there are only two Segments per Impulse.</p> <h3 id="movement-and-battle"><a href="#movement-and-battle" class="header-anchor">#</a> Movement and Battle</h3> <p>During each player Segment, the player first moves whichever unit they wish to move, and then proceeds to attack any enemy units within attacking distance. In other words, a player's turn can be split up into Movement and Battle.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><!----> <span class="next"><a href="/rulebook/play.html">

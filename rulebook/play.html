</code></pre></div><p>There are a few &quot;stray&quot; events shown in this chart that don't fit into the basic gameplay as it is explained in the <a href="/rulebook/index.html#sequence-of-play">Game Intro: Sequence of Play</a>. They are: Guerrilla Sanctuary Adjustment, Intervention Task Force Adjustment, Special Guerrilla Withdrawal, and Desert Water Supply Check. These have been collectively labeled as <a href="#i-tactical-phase-prep">Phase Prep</a> and <a href="#iii-tactical-phase-wrap-up">Phase Wrap-Up</a>.</p> <p>Phase Prep and Phase Wrap-up are very brief portions of the game where adjustments are made by the players. Unlike the Impulses themselves, Prep and Wrap-up are not portions of the game during which players are actively strategizing to win, they are merely &quot;housekeeping.&quot;</p> <h3 id="victory-conditions"><a href="#victory-conditions" class="header-anchor">#</a> Victory Conditions</h3> <p>The game ends immediately if either Habré or Goukouni are eliminated; the player with the surviving Commander is declared the victor.</p> <p>In the event that both players fail to eliminate the rival Commander, the player who occupies N'Djaména with any type of ground unit after a given length of time wins the game. In the Opération Manta scenario, this length of time is equal to two Tactical Phases — one Wet Season, and one Dry Season.</p> <p>In other words, an Opération Manta game lasts a maximum of two Tactical Phases, or six &quot;rounds&quot; (Impulses), representing a full year of campaigning.</p> <h2 id="game-setup"><a href="#game-setup" class="header-anchor">#</a> Game Setup</h2> <h3 id="player-assignment"><a href="#player-assignment" class="header-anchor">#</a> Player assignment</h3> <p>Roll a single dice to decide which player controls which Commander.</p> <ul><li><code>≤ 3</code>: player who rolled is FAN Player (Government Commander)</li> <li><code>≥ 4</code>: player who rolled is FAP Player (Rebel Commander)</li></ul> <h3 id="combat-units-setup"><a href="#combat-units-setup" class="header-anchor">#</a> Combat Units Setup</h3> <blockquote><p><strong>ⓘ</strong> Combat Units Setup is not needed when playing in the simulator.</p></blockquote> <h4 id="government-forces"><a href="#government-forces" class="header-anchor">#</a> <span class="blue">Government Forces</span></h4> <p><strong>Head of Government</strong> : FAN Commander HABRE in Abéché <code>3633</code></p> <ul><li>4x FAN guerrillas in Biltine <code>3730</code></li> <li>4x FAN guerrillas in Sudan Sanctuary</li> <li>3x MPLT guerrillas and MPLT leader in Mao <code>1631</code></li> <li>1x PLA guerrilla and PLA leader in Mongororo <code>4239</code></li> <li>1x FANT 7-3-6 infantry battalion each in N'Djaména <code>1537</code> and Ati <code>2734</code></li> <li>1x FANT 2-2-6 infantry company each in Mongo <code>2838</code>, Am Timan <code>3442</code>, and Boudougour <code>1642</code></li> <li>2x FANT 2-2-6 infantry companies in Salal <code>2429</code></li> <li>2x FANT 2-2-8 recon companies in Abéché <code>3633</code></li></ul> <h4 id="rebel-forces"><a href="#rebel-forces" class="header-anchor">#</a> <span class="red">Rebel Forces</span></h4> <p><strong>Rebel Commander</strong>: FAP Commander GOUKOUNI in Fada <code>3922</code></p> <ul><li>3 x FAP guerrillas in Oum Chalouba <code>3627</code></li> <li>1 x FAP guerrilla in Fada <code>3922</code></li> <li>2 x FAP guerrillas in Faya-Largeau <code>3020</code></li> <li>2 x FAP guerrillas in Kirdimi <code>2819</code></li> <li>3 x CDR guerrillas and CDR leader in Koro Toro <code>2826</code></li> <li>3 x CODOS guerrillas and CODOS leader in Korbol <code>2446</code></li> <li>7 x MRP guerrillas and MRP leader in Moundou <code>1849</code></li></ul> <p>The seven MRP guerrillas are considered independent at the start of the game, and may not move until activated.

No unit may ever exceed its printed Movement Allowance unless it moves only a single hex. While one player moves units, the other player awaits their Segment and is not allowed to move any units.</p> <h5 id="_2-1-1-sanctuaries"><a href="#_2-1-1-sanctuaries" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.1.1 Sanctuaries</h5> <p>Guerrillas which a player wants to place in a Sanctuary should make their way toward the appropriate Sanctuary entry hexes <code>2.4</code>. The Units should then be left in the entry hexes for the remainder of the Movement portion of a player Segment. Guerrillas cannot re-enter the Chadian hex grid from Sanctuary Entry hexes.</p> <p>When Guerrilla Units occopy Sanctuary Entry hexes <code>2.4</code> from a previous player Segment, the Movement portion of a subsequent Segment must begin with moving these units to the Sanctuary proper <code>2.5</code>, from where they are free to enter the Chadian hex grid.</p> <p>In short, Units cannot enter and leave a Santuary in the same player Segment.</p> <h5 id="_2-1-2-stacking-limits"><a href="#_2-1-2-stacking-limits" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.1.2 Stacking Limits</h5> <p>One of the basic limitations on Movement is how many units are allowed to occupy a single hex. <strong>Step Value</strong> is a metric that is used to determine stacking limits. Each unit type has a Step Value assigned to it and a default maximum value of 9 is allowed per hex. The Step Value of each kind of unit can be found on the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#unit-costs-and-values">Unit Costs and Values Chart</a>. The stacking limit for different zones can be found on the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#terrain-effects">Terrain Effects Chart</a>. Commanders and Leaders never count against stacking.</p> <p>Although units can cross through hexes without respecting their stacking limits, each Unit on the game map must respect the maximum stacking limit of the destination hex, when a player is done with the Movement portion of their Segment. Stacking limits also apply throughout the combat portion of each player Segment. At those times, each hex on the map must contain a Step Value of nine (9) or less, regardless of terrain.</p> <p>There is no stacking limit for Sanctuaries.</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: No substitutions or &quot;breakdown&quot; of larger units into smaller units is allowed during Movement. For example, a batallion unit (which corresponds to one game piece) cannot be broken down into three company units (three game pieces). However, a large force — say, three batallions and two companies — may be broken up into its individual units during Movement — two batallions and a company may head toward Salal, while a batallion and a company may break off and head toward Massakori.</p> <h5 id="_2-1-3-terrain-effects"><a href="#_2-1-3-terrain-effects" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.1.3 Terrain Effects</h5> <p>Marshes</p> <ul><li>Perennial Marshes <code>1.4</code> restrict movement year-round, while Seasonal Marshes <code>1.5</code> only restrict movement during the Rain Season (odd-numbered Tactical Phases).</li> <li>See the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#marshes">Terrain Effects Chart</a> for details and exceptions.</li></ul> <p>Rivers</p> <ul><li>The extra +1 movement cost listed on the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#marshes">Terrain Effects Chart</a> does not apply to land units using the Road or Track movement rate when crossing a river.</li></ul> <p>Mountains</p> <ul><li>Mountain defense adjustments and movement costs apply to any hex that contains any portion of mountain terrain.</li></ul> <p>Roads and Tracks</p> <ul><li>Units may use road or track movement rates only when following the road/track through a hexside (including rivers).</li> <li>In marsh hexes, road and track movement rates normally may only be used only during the Dry Season.

all the units they are stacked with suffer elimination as a result of combat. A Leader or Commander not stacked with any friendly combat
units has no combat strength, and is immediately
eliminated the instant an enemy combat unit (not
merely another leader or Commander) enters its
hex for any reason. An eliminated guerrilla leader
is immediately placed in the NEW ARRIVALS
section of the Sanctuary box designated for its faction. If a Commander is eliminated, the game
immediately ends and victory is determined.
Leaders or Commanders cannot be attacked or
eliminated while in a Sanctuary box or the Out of
Country box. See Guerrilla Replacements (12.10)
for further details.</p> <h2 id="iii-tactical-phase-wrap-up"><a href="#iii-tactical-phase-wrap-up" class="header-anchor">#</a> III.

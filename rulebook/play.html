Each unit type has a Step Value assigned to it and a default maximum value of 9 is allowed per hex. The Step Value of each kind of unit can be found on the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#unit-costs-and-values">Unit Costs and Values Chart</a>. The stacking limit for different zones can be found on the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#terrain-effects">Terrain Effects Chart</a>. Commanders and Leaders never count against stacking.</p> <p>Although units can cross through hexes without respecting their stacking limits, each Unit on the game map must respect the maximum stacking limit of the destination hex, when a player is done with the Movement portion of their Segment. Stacking limits also apply throughout the combat portion of each player Segment. At those times, each hex on the map must contain a Step Value of nine (9) or less, regardless of terrain.</p> <p>There is no stacking limit for Sanctuaries.</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: No substitutions or &quot;breakdown&quot; of larger units into smaller units is allowed during Movement.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p> <p>A battalion unit (which is a single game piece) cannot be broken down into three company units (three game pieces).

only one) of the following operations after the
combat differential is calculated, and before combat is actually resolved:</p> <ul><li>Remain in place and defend the target hex
normally</li> <li>Attempt withdrawal</li> <li>Perform an Ambush</li></ul> <p>If any defending units remain in the target

one die for all the guerrilla units in the target hex,
determines how many adjacent hexes contain
enemy combat units, and consults the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#guerrilla-pre-combat-withdrawal">Guerrilla
Pre-Combat Withdrawal Table</a>. Either all
of the guerrilla units in the hex will be allowed to
retreat, or none of them will. Retreating units
must move TWO hexes away in any direction;
they need not remain stacked together.

Commanders, and
leaders he wishes) selects ONE adjacent hex
containing attacking enemy units and immediately performs a special combat against ALL
units in the hex. (Leaders that do not modify the
combat may still join in the ambush. and benefit
or suffer from all combat results received.) This
combat follows all normal rules, except that the
guerrillas are treated as the attacker for all purposes, the original attacking units are treated as
the defenders. Also. the defender (i.e. the original
attacker) receives NO TERRAIN OR IMPROVED POSITION COMBAT BENEFITS. If
any losses, retreats, and advances after combat
occur, the originally scheduled combat's differential will need to be recalculated. If the original
defending force contains NO conventional units.

after the Ambush receive NO TERRAIN OR

scheduled combat. [A pure guerrilla force exposes itself by making an ambush, and lacks
cover from conventional units to return to its
positions.]</p> <h4 id="_2-2-combat-procedure"><a href="#_2-2-combat-procedure" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.2 Combat Procedure</h4> <p>Combat may only occur between adjacent
enemy units. Units are NEVER required to attack. If any unit in a hex attacks, however, ALL
units in the same hex MUST perform combat
against a SINGLE hex occupied by enemy units.
ALL units defending in the hex MUST defend.
Units in different hexes may combine their
strengths when attacking an enemy-occupied hex.
Two or more defending hexes may NOT be
attacked simultaneously.</p> <p>Use the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#combat-determination">Combat Determination Chart</a> to decide which type of combat must be
performed. Selection depends upon the composition of the forces involved in a particular combat,
and the presence of improved positions (Town,
Oasis, or a Fortification marker) in the defender's
hex. If Conventional Combat occurs, use only the
conventional combat strengths printed on both
the attacking and defending units to determine
the proper combat differential. If Guerrilla Combat occurs, use only the guerrilla combat strengths
instead.</p> <p><strong>Important</strong>: No mixing of conventional
and guerrilla combat strengths in a player's attacking or defending force is allowed. Under no
circumstances may one side in a combat use
guerrilla strengths, while the other uses conventional strengths.</p> <p>Determine Combat Results using the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#combat-results">Combat Results Chart</a>.</p> <h4 id="_2-3-terrain-and-combat"><a href="#_2-3-terrain-and-combat" class="header-anchor">#</a> 2.3 Terrain and Combat</h4> <p>The &quot;Defense Adjustment&quot; column of the

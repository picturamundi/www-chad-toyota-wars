While one player moves units, the other player awaits their Segment and is not allowed to move any units.</p> <p>The number of MPs available to a unit is determined by its Movement Allowance, which is displayed on the unit piece (see <a href="/rulebook/#_1-1-combat-units">Combat Units intro</a>). No unit may ever exceed its printed Movement Allowance unless it moves only a single hex.</p> <p>If a player wishes to attack enemy units, they must move the attacking pieces to a position adjacent to the enemy units they wish to attack. This is done during the Movement part of a player Segment; adjacent enemy units are then attacked during Battle (see <a href="#_2-2-combat-procedure">combat procedure</a>).</p> <h5 id="_1-1-2-stacking-limits"><a href="#_1-1-2-stacking-limits" class="header-anchor">#</a> 1.1.2 Stacking Limits</h5> <p>One of the basic limitations on Movement is how many units are allowed to occupy a single hex. &quot;Step Value&quot; is a metric that is used to determine stacking limits.</p> <p>Two charts are used to calculate stacking limits:</p> <ul><li>Each unit type has a Step Value assigned to it. The Step Value of each kind of unit can be found in the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#unit-costs-and-values">Unit Costs and Values Charts</a>.</li> <li>Each type of terrain has a maximum step value allowed. The stacking limit for different zones can be found in the <a href="/rulebook/tables.html#terrain-effects">Terrain Effects Charts</a>.  While the Terrain Effects Charts impose a lower limit in some cases, the default stacking limit is a Step Value of 9.</li></ul> <p>Note that Commanders and Leaders never count against stacking, and that there is no stacking limit in Sanctuaries <code>2.5</code>.</p> <p>Although units can cross through hexes without respecting their stacking limits, each Unit on the game map must respect the maximum stacking limit of the destination hex. Stacking limits also apply throughout the combat portion of each player Segment.</p> <p>No substitutions or &quot;breakdown&quot; of larger units into smaller units is allowed during Movement.</p> <div class="example"></div> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>A battalion unit (which is a single game piece) cannot be broken down into three company units (three game pieces).

the proper combat differential (see <a href="/rulebook/#_1-1-combat-units">Combat Units intro</a>). If Guerrilla Combat occurs, use only the guerrilla combat strengths
instead.</p> <p><strong>Important</strong>: No mixing of conventional
